      This is the supervised learning model on which we have to predict chance of admit using no of parametr
      like GRE score,TOEFL score and many more. In which I use Three types of algorithm that is MLR,RFR and PCA.
      Actually it's classification problem that's why I used PCA to reduce the dimension & make tour task easy.
      for this project I used jupyter notebook IDE to accomplished this task.
